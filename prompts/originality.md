# Prompt: Originality Score

Evaluate only the true novelty of the paper on a 0-10 scale.

- `0-3`: widely explored idea, just a rehash of existing work.
- `4-6`: known idea with a respectable twist or combination.
- `7-8`: genuinely new concept on a core building block (architecture, dataset, paradigm).
- `9-10`: clear breakthrough or entirely new family of techniques.

Ignore feasibility or impact; rate solely how different the work is from the current state of the art.
