# Prompt: Technical Impact Score

Provide a 0-10 score for the potential technical impact on the community.

- `0-3`: marginal gain, brittle solution, or weak experimental evidence.
- `4-6`: credible incremental improvement on a narrow benchmark, impact limited to a niche.
- `7-8`: advance that unlocks a new use case or significantly raises the state of the art across several tasks.
- `9-10`: paradigm shift with rigorous validations that point to a future standard.

Ignore originality or reproducibility; measure only the technical value the approach would bring if adopted.
