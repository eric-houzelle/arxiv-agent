# Prompt: Reproducibility Score

Assign a 0-10 score describing how easily a standard lab can reproduce the results.

- `0-3`: missing critical details, proprietary dependencies, or highly specialized resources.
- `4-6`: partial instructions or high expertise required, but still doable with effort.
- `7-8`: well-documented methodology with code/data available and reasonable resource needs.
- `9-10`: near plug-and-play protocol, complete open-source release, demonstrated reproducibility.

Do not judge scientific value; focus solely on clarity, transparency, and the resources required to replicate the study.
