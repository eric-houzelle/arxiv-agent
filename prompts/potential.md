# Prompt: Short-Term Potential Score

Assign a 0-10 score for the likelihood that the paper will yield concrete applications within 12-18 months.

- `0-3`: highly speculative idea or dependent on unlikely external breakthroughs.
- `4-6`: use case exists but requires significant maturation or validation before adoption.
- `7-8`: aligned with strong market demand and only limited blockers to adoption.
- `9-10`: ready for industrialization, obvious business value, potential partners or customers already clear.

Ignore pure scientific difficulty; focus on whether the work can become a product, tool, or standard quickly.
